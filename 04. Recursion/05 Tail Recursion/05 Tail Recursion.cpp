	Tail Recursion:
	when the last thing that happens in function
	is a recursive call.

	Eg: print n to 1 is a tail recursive code

	Tail Recursive codes are faster, efficient and takes
	less space than non-tail recursive codes.

	In execution of tail recursive codes, compiler does
	not need to save the state of previous function calls.

	Non-tail recursive codes can be converted to tail recursive code
	by passing an extra parameter.
