	Self Balancing BST:

	--> Keep the height O(logN)
	
	--> As operations in BST depend on
	height. 
	
	--> If height if logN then all operations
	will be in O(logN) time.
	
	--> These tree restructure(re-balancing or rotation) themselves upon 
	insertion/deletion.

	--> If we know keys in advance then sort the keys 
	and make middle element as root and repeat it
	for further nodes.

	--> Types of rotations: 
		a. left rotation
		b. right rotation

	--> Examples of BST:
		a. AVL Tree - strict in making self BST
		b. Red Black Tree - slight loose in making BST

	--> C++ libraries (set and map) use Red Black Tree
