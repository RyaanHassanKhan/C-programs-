	Asymtotic Analysis:

	1. Computes running time of any algorithm
	2. Independent of machine, programming language etc-
	3. Goal is to calculate: best case, average case, worst case

	Example:
	
	asymptotic analysis:
	we are considering sum of n natural numbers example 
	(code in previous folder)

	sum1 analysis is: c1*n*n + c2*n + c3
	sum2 analysis is: c4*n +c5
	sum3 analysis id: c6

	now ignore lower order terms and constants.
	so, analysis becomes:
	-->n*n
	-->n
	-->1

	so, order of growth is 1 < n < n*n or sum3 < sum2 < sum1 

	note: we consider n very large while doing asymtotic analysis
